The game is created during my employment at Motekforce Link as a project for Northeastern University.  I served as the only programmer and did most of the design work. I also had a lot of interaction with the client to iterate on the game.

The game is controlled by the players balance. By leaning towards a direction the player moves forwards, backwards or turns around. There is also a marker attached to the hand of the player which is used so that the player can reach towards targets.
 
The goal of the game is for the player to follow a path of fireflies through a magical forest within a specific time. Along the path there are tasks where the player has limited time to reach towards a target and save a trapped bunny. Along the path there are barriers and fireflies that turn malicious and have to be avoided. At the end the player sees their final score and for every successful task an extra bunny appears.

There are three handmade paths in the game that have a limited random variety within them for the placement of things on the path. A therapist can choose the path and also has additional control over other game factors such as the duration of the game, the number of tasks or the amount of malicious fireflies.
