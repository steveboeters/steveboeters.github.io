A project that is [a follow-up of a prototype](/portfolio/rijndamdemonstration) to help people train that have issues with the motor skills in their hands. This project contains a number of exercises that train different movements of the hands and fingers of a patient. These exercises can be changed in difficulty and the performance of the player is tracked so that a therapist can evaluate and help them improve. The project has been created in cooperation with therapists and patients to create something that suits their needs well. 

I have been the project lead on the project and my responsibities include handling the communication between our hardware partner and development team and coordinating multiple partners to setup the test sessions. Next to managing the project I have also done a lot of design work.

The video below is in Dutch but shows different elements of the project.
