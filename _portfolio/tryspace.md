This is a project that is in development made to research how well VR can be used to evaluate aggressive behaviour in children. Most of the application consists out of two games (stacking blocks and throwing over cans) with a number of scenarios that intend to provoke the participant by for example having virtual characters not allowing the participant to play the game. In each scenario an operator can control the application through a standalone interface and can do things such as triggering pre-recorded voice responses with the characters.

I have been the lead on the project and have done most of the implementation work on the VR side of things. This includes things such as scoring, adding content (voicelines, scenarios), input, audio and automatic storing of videos for playback.
