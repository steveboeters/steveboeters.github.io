This is a project to research how well VR can be used to evaluate aggressive behaviour in children. The largest part of the application consists out of two games (stacking blocks and throwing over cans) with a number of scenarios that intend to trigger aggression in the participant. Examples of this are being socially excluded with a game or losing a competition. In each scenario an operator can control the application through a standalone interface and can do things such as triggering pre-recorded voice responses with the characters.

I have been the lead on the project and have done most of the implementation work for the Unity VR application. This includes things such as scoring, adding content (voicelines, scenarios), input, audio and automatic storing of videos for playback.
